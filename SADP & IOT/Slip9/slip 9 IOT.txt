slip 9	Write python programs on Pi :  
a)	Read your name and print Hello message with name 
b)	Read two numbers and print their sum, difference, product and division.  
c)	Word and character count of a given string.  
d)	Area of a given shape (rectangle, triangle and circle) reading shape and appropriate  
	values from standard input. 
Here are Python programs for each of the tasks specified. These programs can be executed on a Raspberry Pi or any system with Python installed.

Program (a): Greeting with Name
This program reads the user's name and prints a greeting message.

python
Copy code
# Program to greet the user
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
Program (b): Basic Arithmetic Operations
This program reads two numbers and calculates their sum, difference, product, and division.

python
Copy code
# Program to perform arithmetic operations on two numbers
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Calculating and displaying results
print(f"Sum: {num1 + num2}")
print(f"Difference: {num1 - num2}")
print(f"Product: {num1 * num2}")
if num2 != 0:
    print(f"Division: {num1 / num2}")
else:
    print("Division: Cannot divide by zero")
Program (c): Word and Character Count of a String
This program takes a string as input and counts the words and characters.

python
Copy code
# Program to count words and characters in a string
text = input("Enter a string: ")

# Counting words and characters
word_count = len(text.split())
character_count = len(text)

print(f"Word count: {word_count}")
print(f"Character count: {character_count}")
Program (d): Area of Different Shapes
This program calculates the area of a rectangle, triangle, or circle based on user input.

python
Copy code
# Program to calculate the area of different shapes
import math

shape = input("Enter the shape (rectangle, triangle, circle): ").strip().lower()

if shape == "rectangle":
    length = float(input("Enter the length of the rectangle: "))
    width = float(input("Enter the width of the rectangle: "))
    area = length * width
    print(f"Area of the rectangle: {area}")

elif shape == "triangle":
    base = float(input("Enter the base of the triangle: "))
    height = float(input("Enter the height of the triangle: "))
    area = 0.5 * base * height
    print(f"Area of the triangle: {area}")

elif shape == "circle":
    radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the circle: "))
    area = math.pi * radius * radius
    print(f"Area of the circle: {area}")

else:
    print("Invalid shape entered.")
