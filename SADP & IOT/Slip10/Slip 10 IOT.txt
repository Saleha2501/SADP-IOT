	Write python programs on Pi like:                                                                                    
a)	Print a name 'n' times, where name and n are read from standard input, using for and while loops.                                                                                                                       
b)	Handle Divided by Zero Exception.                                                                             
c)	Print current time for 10 times with an interval of10seconds.                                       
d)	Read a fileline byline and print the word count of each line 	[15 M] 

Program (a): Print a Name 'n' Times Using for and while Loops
This program takes a name and an integer n as input and prints the name n times using both for and while loops.

python
Copy code
# Read inputs
name = input("Enter a name: ")
n = int(input("Enter the number of times to print the name: "))

# Using for loop
print("\nUsing for loop:")
for i in range(n):
    print(name)

# Using while loop
print("\nUsing while loop:")
count = 0
while count < n:
    print(name)
    count += 1
Program (b): Handle Division by Zero Exception
This program attempts a division and handles the ZeroDivisionError exception if the denominator is zero.

python
Copy code
# Read two numbers and handle division by zero
try:
    numerator = float(input("Enter the numerator: "))
    denominator = float(input("Enter the denominator: "))
    
    # Perform division
    result = numerator / denominator
    print(f"Result: {result}")

except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
Program (c): Print Current Time 10 Times with an Interval of 10 Seconds
This program prints the current time 10 times, with a 10-second interval between each print.

python
Copy code
import time
from datetime import datetime

# Print current time 10 times with 10 seconds interval
for _ in range(10):
    print("Current Time:", datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"))
    time.sleep(10)  # Sleep for 10 seconds
Program (d): Read a File Line by Line and Print the Word Count of Each Line
This program reads a text file line by line and prints the word count for each line. Replace 'example.txt' with your file's path.

python
Copy code
# File path (Replace 'example.txt' with the path to your file)
file_path = 'example.txt'

# Open the file and process each line
try:
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        line_number = 1
        for line in file:
            words = line.split()
            word_count = len(words)
            print(f"Line {line_number}: {word_count} words")
            line_number += 1

except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"Error: The file '{file_path}' was not found.")
